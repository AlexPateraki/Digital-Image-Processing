# Digital-Image-Processing
Some exercises for digital image processing  
1) Read an image and extract its bit-planes. Reconstruct the original image by combining the bit-planes starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. Observe the results.

2) Implement a halftoning technique for grayscale images, where the program takes a grayscale image as input and creates a halftone image according to the specified methodology.

3) Implement a local histogram equalization technique for neighborhoods of [m x n] pixels (with m and n as input parameters) and return the processed image.

4) Reduce the number of intensity levels in an image from 256 to 2^n (where n is a variable input) using a computer program.

5) Apply entropy coding, specifically Huffman coding, to an image. Calculate compression rates for different approaches, such as applying Huffman coding directly to the image and after predictive coding, and compare the results. Analyze the differences in compression achieved and provide conclusions based on the observed results.
